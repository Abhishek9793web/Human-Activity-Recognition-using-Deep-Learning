üìä Classification Report Explanation
üéØ Overview
The classification report shows how well your LSTM model performed on the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset. The model achieved 82% overall accuracy on the test set.
ÔøΩÔøΩ Activity Classes (0-indexed)
Class 0 = WALKING (Label 1 in original data)
Class 1 = WALKING_UPSTAIRS (Label 2 in original data)
Class 2 = WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (Label 3 in original data)
Class 3 = SITTING (Label 4 in original data)
Class 4 = STANDING (Label 5 in original data)
Class 5 = LAYING (Label 6 in original data)


üìà Metrics Breakdown
1. Precision
Definition: Of all the samples the model predicted as a specific class, how many were actually correct
Formula: True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
Interpretation: Higher precision means fewer false alarms
2. Recall (Sensitivity)
Definition: Of all the actual samples of a specific class, how many did the model correctly identify
Formula: True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
Interpretation: Higher recall means fewer missed detections
3. F1-Score
Definition: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
Formula: 2 √ó (Precision √ó Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
Interpretation: Balanced measure between precision and recall
4. Support
Definition: Number of actual samples of each class in the test set
Interpretation: Shows class distribution

ÔøΩÔøΩ Key Insights

Best Performing Activities:
LAYING (Class 5): 97% F1-score - Almost perfect detection
STANDING (Class 4): 81% F1-score - Very good performance
WALKING_UPSTAIRS (Class 1): 80% F1-score - Excellent performance
Challenging Activities:
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (Class 2): 75% F1-score - Moderate performance
WALKING (Class 0): 77% F1-score - Good but room for improvement
SITTING (Class 3): 78% F1-score - Good performance


üìä Overall Metrics
Accuracy: 82%
Definition: Overall percentage of correct predictions
Interpretation: The model correctly classified 82% of all test samples
Macro Average: 82% precision, 81% recall, 81% F1
Definition: Simple average across all classes (treats all classes equally)
Interpretation: Good balanced performance across all activities
Weighted Average: 82% precision, 82% recall, 82% F1
Definition: Average weighted by the number of samples in each class
Interpretation: Accounts for class imbalance, still shows good performance



üîç Performance Analysis
Why LAYING is Perfect:
Static activity with very distinct sensor patterns
Minimal movement makes it easy to distinguish from other activities
Consistent sensor readings across different subjects
Why WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS is Challenging:
Similar to WALKING_UPSTAIRS - both involve stair movement
Sensor patterns overlap with regular walking
Variability in how people descend stairs
Why SITTING has Lower Recall:
Similar to STANDING - both are static activities
Model sometimes confuses sitting and standing
Lower recall (71%) means it misses some sitting instances

üöÄ Model Performance Summary
‚úÖ Overall Accuracy: 82% - Good performance
‚úÖ Balanced Performance: Similar precision and recall across classes
‚úÖ Strong Detection: Excellent performance on static activities (LAYING, STANDING)
‚ö†Ô∏è Room for Improvement: Dynamic activities (WALKING variants) could be better
‚úÖ Robust Model: Handles class imbalance well
